## Technical Issues and Solutions

### Prisma Client Issues
1. **Problem**: Persistent Prisma client initialization problems
2. **Solution**: 
   - Updated Prisma client initialization code to use singleton pattern
   - Modified output path in schema.prisma to be Windows-friendly:

   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
     output   = "../node_modules/.prisma/client"
   }
   ```

2. **Solution**:
   - Fixed session handling
   - Ensured proper user role management
   - Updated API routes to use consistent db instance

### Build and Development Issues

2. **Solution**:
   - Cleaned up build files
   - Regenerated Prisma client

### API Route Fixes
1. **Problem**: Inconsistent Prisma client usage across API routes
2. **Solution**:
